** Database Migration Project **
This project handles the migration of two legacy databases into a single, unified database structure. The goal is to clean, merge, and standardize data (Books, Authors, Topics, etc.) from older exports into a new format.

# Project Structure
-- export_booksCollection/: Raw CSV exports from the first legacy database (DB1).

-- export_books_2004/: Raw CSV exports from the second legacy database (DB2).

--merged_csv/: The result of merging the two sources.

-- final_tables/: Cleaned and finalized tables ready for the new database.

-- scripts/: Python scripts used for cleaning, comparing, and merging the data.

-- scripts_migration/: Specialized scripts for handling complex logic of the migration

# How It Works
The migration process is automated using Python scripts that:

1. Read data from the legacy source folders.

2. Clean & Standardize text (handling special characters, whitespace, etc.).

3. Analyze unique identifiers (like ISBNs) to detect duplicates.

4. Merge the datasets into the merged_csv folder.

5. Generate final output files in final_tables.
